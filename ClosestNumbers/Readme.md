### Q. Closest Numbers Hackerank:

        To determine which pair or pairs of elements have the smallest absolute difference between them.
        arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
        Sorted arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
        The minimum difference is 1 here.
        pairs : [(1,2), (2,3) , (3,4) , (4,5) ]

        O/P : 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5

        I/P:
        4
        5 4 3 2
        O/P:
        2 3 3 4 4 5

        Explanation :
        Here, the minimum difference is 1. Valid pairs are (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 5).
