<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Ever wonder how to measure if the text is hard or easy to read? For a human this task is pretty simple: you just read the text and feel if you're struggling or not. But how to teach a computer do that? In this project, you will write such a program.</p>

<p>Firstly, let's create a simple program. If the text contains more than 100 symbols (including spacebars and punctuation) then the text is considered hard to read. Else, the text is considered easy to read. If the text contains exactly 100 symbols then it is still easy to read.</p>

<p>The input contains a single line with text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is simple to read!
EASY</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">&gt; This text is hard to read. It contains a lot of sentences as well as a lot of words in each sentence.
HARD</code></pre>
